<!-- Chain Contract -->
<!-- inputs: user_request, jstack_config -->
<!-- outputs: structured_result -->

Read the setup preamble first:
!cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/setup/preamble.md

## What this skill is for
Route sprint requests to the right sub-skill (planning, mid-sprint re-plan). Provide capacity and goal context.
- **Out of scope:** Moving Jira issues between sprints without user confirmation.

## Domain rules — sprint
- Do not silently drop committed work: show spill reasons (dependency, new critical work, scope).
- If historical velocity data is missing, use T-shirt estimates with a conversion note.

## Sub-skills (pick the most specific)
**Under `skills/sprint/`:** prep (inputs / goals / scope), refinement (backlog grooming), planning (capacity, commitment, Jira board / sprint create or continue)

- **New sprint / carryover:** Operational steps (move incomplete issues vs copy board layout) live in **`planning`** together with Jira MCP moves; spill **narrative** (reasons, themes) can be a separate write-up or future `sprint/carryover` skill if your pack adds one. Prefer **`jira/sprint-board`** (or host Jira tools) for bulk moves only after user confirms.

If the user is vague, ask **one** question to disambiguate, then route to the child skill. Do not execute every sub-skill in one turn unless the user asked for a chain.

## Config and references
- `jstack.config.json` — team ids, integrations, `skill_defaults`, `jira_rules`, `notion`, `gbrain`. Never hardcode.
- Questions (open-ended, one at a time): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/question-patterns.md`
- Discrete choices (when the host supports AskUserQuestion or equivalent): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/ask-user-question-patterns.md`
- Integrations: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/integration-guide.md`
- Chaining: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/chaining-guide.md`

## Intake
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` — note whether the user **pasted** data or is asking you to **query** a system.
2. If a required id is missing, ask **one** focused question; otherwise use config defaults (label assumptions as `[assumption]`).
3. If the request bundles multiple unrelated goals, handle the first and offer to continue.

## Procedure
### Step 1 — Load config
Read relevant keys from `jstack.config.json`. If the integration is missing or unhealthy, say so and point to `jstack setup` / `jstack doctor` instead of faking data.

### Step 2 — Plan the safe path
Prefer read-only first, then idempotent updates, then irreversible changes — each gated by org norms.

### Step 3 — Execute
Route to the most specific child skill under `skills/sprint/`. If the user's intent is clear, emit `suggested_next: <child-skill>` and stop. If ambiguous, ask one question to disambiguate before routing.

### Step 4 — Validate
Correct surface, no stray side effects, tone matches `prompts/tones/` if publishing text.

### Step 5 — Summarize and hand off
State what changed, what to verify, and suggest **one** next jstack skill if the work naturally continues.

## Output shape
Use a domain-appropriate heading, then:
- **Summary** (2–4 sentences)
- **Details** (bullets, table, or structured fields)
- **Next steps** with owner + timeline if known
- **Limitations** (partial data, no write access, etc.)
- For eval-gated skills, end with `result_ok: true` or `result_ok: false` + reason

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Missing config / integration | Point to `jstack setup` or `jstack doctor`; do not continue with invented ids. |
| Auth / 403 / expired token | Stop; tell user to refresh credentials. Never print secrets. |
| Ambiguous goal | One clarifying question; if still unclear, present options A/B. |
| No velocity data available | Use T-shirt estimates with a conversion note; do not invent points. |
| Sprint scope exceeds capacity | Show the gap and suggest which items to defer. |

## Chaining
This is a **domain orchestrator** — route to the most specific child skill. Do not inline every sub-flow. If the user's task maps to one child, say `suggested_next: <child-skill>` and stop.
