Read the setup preamble first:

## What this skill is for
Reconcile a new record against what is already stored: find near-duplicates, then merge, supersede, or link — and ask before writing. The written output can also be a Notion knowledge-base entry directly, when that is the configured canonical store, rather than only a gbrain record.
- **Out of scope:** Extracting the record from raw text (`jstack:knowledge-intake`) and answering questions from the store (`jstack:knowledge-search`). Never silently overwrite an existing entry.

## Domain rules — knowledge
- **Lookup vs store:** `jstack:knowledge-search` answers from configured sources (`knowledge_base` in config). Intake/process store into gbrain/Notion. See `skills/knowledge/references/gbrain-patterns.md`.
- Intake raw notes → process (tag, dedupe, link) → route to gbrain/Notion per config.
- No invented hierarchy: if a page id is missing, return markdown the user can paste.
- Deduplication: merge duplicates; keep the oldest decision link as canonical.

## Config and references
- `jstack.config.json` — team ids, integrations, `skill_defaults`, `jira_rules`, `notion`, `gbrain`. Never hardcode.
- Questions (open-ended, one at a time): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/question-patterns.md`
- Discrete choices (when the host supports AskUserQuestion or equivalent): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/ask-user-question-patterns.md`
- Integrations: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/integration-guide.md`
- Chaining: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_core/references/chaining-guide.md`

## Intake
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` — note whether the user **pasted** data or is asking you to **query** a system.
2. If a required id is missing, ask **one** focused question; otherwise use config defaults (label assumptions as `[assumption]`).
3. If the request bundles multiple unrelated goals, handle the first and offer to continue.

## Procedure
### Step 1 — Load config
Read relevant keys from `jstack.config.json`. If the integration is missing or unhealthy, say so and point to `jstack setup` / `jstack doctor` instead of faking data.

### Step 2 — Plan the safe path
Search for near-duplicates before writing anything new — unresolved duplicates make later retrieval untrustworthy. Carry source and as-of time on every entry. Ask before persisting, and honour the session's team-vs-personal target rather than defaulting to shared.

### Step 3 — Execute
Dedupe, merge near-duplicates, set canonical link.
- If Notion + gbrain, pick one canonical per topic (user can override).

### Step 4 — Validate
Confirm the entry is findable by the query a future reader would actually use, that provenance is attached, and that no duplicate was left unresolved. Confirm it went to the intended team-vs-personal target.

### Step 5 — Summarize and hand off
State what changed, what to verify, and suggest **one** next jstack skill if the work naturally continues.

## Output shape
Use a domain-appropriate heading, then:
- **Summary** (2–4 sentences)
- **Details** (bullets, table, or structured fields)
- **Next steps** with owner + timeline if known
- **Limitations** (partial data, no write access, etc.)
- For eval-gated skills, end with `result_ok: true` or `result_ok: false` + reason

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Missing config / integration | Point to `jstack setup` or `jstack doctor`; do not continue with invented ids. |
| Auth / 403 / expired token | Stop; tell user to refresh credentials. Never print secrets. |
| Ambiguous goal | One clarifying question; if still unclear, present options A/B. |
| Duplicate entry detected | Show the existing canonical and ask: merge, update, or skip. |

## Chaining
Complete the work here. If a natural follow-up exists (e.g. `jstack-knowledge-intake` then `jstack-knowledge-process`), add one line: `suggested_next: <skill-name>` with a copy-paste handoff block. Do not auto-invoke without user intent or a defined chain in `prompts/chains/`.
